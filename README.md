# ERM-project
This project is a web-based internal application designed to manage projects and track the progress of people in training programs, internships, or internal company projects.
It allows managers and team leads to assign users to projects, define milestones, monitor progress, and provide feedback—all through an intuitive and professional dashboard.

The main goal is to simulate the functionality of a real internal tool, similar to a lightweight ERP, demonstrating technical skills and teamwork capabilities.

## Project Objective:

Develop a professional MVP that reflects how projects and personnel are managed in a real business environment.

Showcase competencies in frontend, backend, databases, and role-based access control.

Demonstrate best development practices such as version control, pull requests, and collaborative teamwork.
